# CreatingInstaller

Creates an installer for .NET Core Windows Service.

This .NET Core project is related to my [blog](https://ajaxzen.wordpress.com/2020/07/31/how-to-create-an-installer-for-net-core-windows-services-part-ii/) that explains the process of creating an installer and integrating it w/ Visual Studio.

To avoid any licensing rules, installer_inno directory was not checked-in therefore, read over the blog to replicate that missing directory on your local.
